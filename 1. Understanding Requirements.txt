1. Understanding Requirements
The agent should:

Leverage RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) architecture.
Expose APIs for querying and responding to insights.
Work with provided JSON data as the source.
Handle logical, insight-driven questions (e.g., filtering, summarizing, top-k selection).
Handle follow-ups and manage negative or incorrect questions gracefully.
Provide security and exception handling for APIs.
2. Architecture Overview
Input Source: JSON data files (parsing and ingestion into a structured database).
Backend:
ETL Process: Load JSON data into a database (SQLite or PostgreSQL).
Data Operations: SQL queries to extract insights.
AI Integration: Use a language model (e.g., OpenAI GPT or similar) for language understanding.
Question Parsing: Identify keywords (e.g., "Top 5 invoices," "highest balance").
RAG Pipeline:
Retriever: Fetch relevant data from the database based on query context.
Generator: Use GPT to convert structured data into human-like responses.
API Layer: Expose endpoints using Flask or FastAPI.
Security: Add API authentication, rate-limiting, and input validation.
3. Functional Requirements
Core Capabilities
Insights Generation:
Filtering (e.g., "Top 5 invoices").
Summarization (e.g., "summary of an invoice").
Comparisons (e.g., "highest balance invoice").
Question Handling:
Parse user intent.
Recognize valid vs. invalid questions.
Offer suggestions or clarifications for ambiguous queries.
Follow-ups:
Maintain query context for follow-up questions.
Handling Incorrect Questions
Respond politely with suggestions or ask for clarification:
"I’m sorry, I didn’t understand that question. Can you rephrase or ask about invoices or projects?"
4. API Design
Endpoints
/ingest
Load and preprocess the JSON data into a database.
/query
Accept user questions, process them, and return answers.
/validate
Verify if the query is valid or requires clarification.

Example API Contracts
/ingest
json
Copy code
POST /ingest
Body: {"file_path": "path/to/json"}
Response: {"status": "success", "message": "Data ingested"}
/query
json
Copy code
POST /query
Body: {"question": "List down the Top 5 invoices for Project X"}
Response: {
    "answer": [
        {"Invoice ID": "58820", "Contractor": "John Doe", "Vendor": "ABC Ltd", "Amount": 50000},
        ...
    ]
}


5. Key Features
Data Processing
Parse JSON into a relational database.
Use SQL queries for aggregation and filtering.
Question Handling Workflow
Intent Recognition: Use NLP models to classify the question (e.g., "top-k," "summarization").
Data Querying:
Query database for structured results.
Response Generation:
Convert SQL results to natural language responses.
RAG Implementation
Retriever: Search relevant records using SQL queries.
Generator: Use a pre-trained GPT model to generate human-like responses.
Follow-Up Handling
Maintain a session context to track previous queries and responses.



6. Security
Authentication: Use token-based auth (e.g., JWT).
Rate Limiting: Limit API calls to prevent abuse.
Input Validation: Sanitize inputs to avoid SQL injection.
HTTPS: Ensure secure communication.




7. Exception Handling
Invalid Data: Return a 400 error for invalid input data.
Ambiguous Questions: Ask for clarification if the intent isn’t clear.
API Errors: Return standardized error responses with detailed messages.




9. Testing & Validation
Unit Tests: Test individual API endpoints.
Integration Tests: Validate complete workflows.
Edge Cases: Handle invalid data, ambiguous questions, and large datasets.



10. Deployment
Use a containerized approach with Docker.
Deploy on a cloud platform (AWS, GCP, or Azure) with managed databases.
This approach provides a robust framework for building the Insight Assistant Agent with all required functionalities. Let me know if you'd like assistance with specific components!
